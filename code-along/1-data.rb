# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

## In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# #Numbers
# puts 5
# puts 48
# Non-numbers
# puts 46 * 2
# puts "tacos" +  3.to_s

# #True, False

# #Nothing

# Variables
# tacos = 3
# burritos = 2
# puts tacos * burritos

## Combine strings and variables

# first_name = "Brandon"
# last_name = "Chubb"
# email = "#{first_name} #{last_name}, nice to connect! Lmk when you're free next week!"
# puts email


## String manipulation
puts "hello".swapcase
